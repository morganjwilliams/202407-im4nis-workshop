Description from the DAP dataset record:
The project focused on low-grade metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration of
mafic volcanic rocks of the Archaean Fortescue Group of the Hamersley Basin,
Western Australia.  This involved (a) establishing patterns of authigenic
mineral growth in the volcanics which led to a broad pattern of four
metamorphic zones; (b) mapping of hydrothermal alteration/metasomatism of the
mafic lavas; and (c) studying patterns of whole-rock geochemistry of alteration
as well as compositions of least-altered massive parts of lava flows.
